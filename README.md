# Android Beacon Scanner #

A simple android beacon scanner that can recognize iBeacons, Eddystone beacons (UID and URL, with or without TLM) and AltBeacons [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bridou_n.beaconscanner).

Available for android 4.3+ and smartphones with Bluetooth LE.

## Features ##

The following informations are displayed:

 - The type of beacon (iBeacon, AltBeacon or Eddystone)
 - UUID, Major & Minor for iBeacons and AltBeacons
 - Manufacturer code
 - The RSSI and RX values
 - The approximation of the distance with the beacon (this is based on the RSSI value received and is NOT accurate)
 - NamespaceID & InstanceID for Eddystone-UID beacons
 - Clickable URL for Eddystone-URL beacons
 - TLM data sent with the Eddystone beacons (if any)
 - The last time the beacon has been seen

It can display several frames emitted by a single beacon, allowing you to see if a beacon emits multiple frames types (for example radius network beacons can emit iBeacon and AltBeacon at the same time)!

## Main libraries used ##

 - [AltBeacon](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library)
	 - Scanning for beacons nearby
	 - Making the difference between iBeacons, AltBeacons and Eddystone beacons
	 - Easily getting data emitted by the beacons (UUID, major, minor, namespaceID...)
 - [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-java)
	 - Storing and retrieving data on the phone
 - [RxJava (& RxAndroid)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
	 - Easily threading, low benefit in such a small app
 - [Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/)
	 - Inject dependencies such as Realm, BeaconManager and Animations into the app
 - [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
	 - Bind Android views to fields.
 - [TapTargetView](https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView)
	- Material design discovery feature made easy

If any of you guys have feedback about the utilisation I made of theses libraries in my project, I'd love to hear it!
